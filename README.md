# VoiceChatLib
Voice Chat Library - a script that makes working with [FiguraSVC](https://github.com/KnownSH/FiguraSVC) v2.0 easier

## Library purpose:
Although FiguraSVC is a very useful addon for the Figura mod, using it in its pure form is quite difficult.

The purpose of this library is to facilitate the processing of raw audio data. Along with the raw data, it is now possible to also obtain the actual voice volume, allowing you to focus solely on creating speaking mouths and other audio-dependent features instead of wasting time on audio processing.

## Installation
The process of installing the script is quite simple

1. Download the script from this repository.
2. Place it in the directory with your avatar.
3. Initialize the library via `avatar.json` file.
